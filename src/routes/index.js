    using getChildRoutes with the following signature:

    getChildRoutes (location, cb) {
      require.ensure([], (require) => {

          // Remove imports!
          require('./Counter').default(store)

    However, this is not necessary for code-splitting! It simply provides
    an API for async route definitions. Your code splitting should occur
    inside the route `getComponent` function, since it is only invoked
    when the route exists and matches.
